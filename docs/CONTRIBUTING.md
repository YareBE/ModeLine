# How to contribute?

### Here are some rules and instructions to follow so as to contribute efficiently and keep the project as clean as possible 


## First steps:
In order to bring the repository to your local IDE you must clone the url, either with the vscode interface or with the following git bash command:
"git clone 'https://github.com/YareBE/ModeLine'".
Use "git fetch" or "git pull" (fetch + merge) to update your local repository with its latest version on github.

For anything interface-related, take a look at [Streamlit's official documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/)

## Pull and push:
If you have the status of collaborator, you can directly modify the main branch by staging (git add 'file') the changes, commiting (git commit -m 'Message') and pushing the changes to github from the branch you want (for instance, git push origin 'branch')

On the other hand, if you are just a visitor of the project, and want to change, fix something or add new features, you must follow the steps described above. Once you try to push, a "fork creation" option will be suggested to you.

This will create an exact copy of the github repo under your account and, from there, you can open a "pull request". This request will appear in the original main and an authorized person can decide whether to accept, discard or integrate ir partially.

## Working policies
Contributors are encouraged to create various branches, each one operating with different aspects (refactoring, updating docs, adding a new feature, experimenting...), thus providing a dynamic environment. The main branch should always be completely functional.
It is desirable (but not mandatory) to follow the branches naming convention in the next link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git/how-to-naming-conventions-for-git-branches.

It is also preferable to write commits after an extended and well-known standard: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0

## Documentation
When updating any markdown file, it is important to stick to its set of rules and being rigorous with the format and information displayed.

Some examples are the [README](https://github.com/YareBE/ModeLine/blob/main/README.md), which contains a description of the project functioning, installing guide and how to use it correctly; and the current file, CONTRIBUTING, a collection of advices and directions to be a part of the project while keeping it tidy.
